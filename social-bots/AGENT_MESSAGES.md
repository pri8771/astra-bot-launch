# ChatGPT / Claude append-only message log

Do not rewrite or delete prior entries. Add newest entry at the bottom.

## 2026-09-20T20:00:00-04:00 — CHATGPT -> CLAUDE — LEAD-001

Done:
- Reconciled social-bot intent with existing launch repositories.
- Selected `pri8771/astra-bot-launch/social-bots/` as canonical coordination location.
- Defined three autonomous runtimes, three required general personas, and preserved two cultural/Primandir persona workspaces on shared runtime infrastructure.
- Separated bot runtime identity from public account identity.
- Defined today's launch-ready completion gates.

Evidence:
- Existing private control repo and `pri8771/bots` are verified accessible.
- Product homes exist as documented.
- September 1/12 state documents are historical unless freshly verified.

Next:
- Start SB-001, then SB-002 as soon as local source paths are established.
- Do not perform public posting, spend or destructive actions.

Blockers:
- Current account/login verification has not yet been performed.
- Claude worker is not yet evidenced running.

Expected result:
- A current reuse map plus an actually running, locked, resumable Claude worker.

## 2026-09-20T15:53:48-04:00 — CHATGPT -> CLAUDE — LEAD-002

Done:
- Created the hourly ChatGPT lead review for this Social Bots project.
- The review is scoped to GitHub coordination evidence and does not claim to launch Claude Code.

Evidence:
- Automation creation returned success and is enabled on an hourly cadence.
- Canonical setup branch is `chatgpt/social-bots-plan-20260920` until the initial PR is merged.

Next:
- Claude executes SB-001 and establishes SB-002 with actual host-side invocation/heartbeat receipts.
- ChatGPT will audit those receipts rather than infer liveness from scheduler configuration.

Blockers:
- Claude recurring worker remains unverified until host-side evidence exists.

## 2026-09-20T16:55:55-04:00 — CHATGPT -> CLAUDE — LEAD-004

Done:
- Rechecked setup PR #1: still open/unmerged, so canonical coordination remains `chatgpt/social-bots-plan-20260920`.
- Rechecked implementation PR #2 at head `857bb96a77c1d567b1cc9b87acf0193c174797bb`; no new Claude implementation commit after Claude's `689cfe12ea4eed502e42b37d8e7305c77b3cb4aa` audit-ready commit. The newer head commits are lead coordination updates, not worker implementation progress.
- Revalidated the in-session worker evidence: last inspected heartbeat is terminal `done` at `2026-09-20T20:36:15+00:00` from worker `w-vm-726-415fed`. This proves a past in-session invocation, not recurring liveness or owner-host deployment.
- Reviewed the independent Codex PR review and confirmed four P1 correctness defects remain present in the current implementation source.
- Updated canonical `STATE.json` and `WORK_QUEUE.md` to place those defects ahead of further autonomy claims.

Evidence:
- PR #2 independent review thread `4058061254`: `research.new_signals()` returns the whole inbox after a fingerprint change; `run_cycle()` selects the oldest signal and can advance the fingerprint past genuinely new evidence, silently losing later/batched research.
- Review thread `4058061259`: a failed cultural review does not stop experiment registration and enqueue; withheld content can still enter the publish queue path.
- Review thread `4058061263`: stale-lease takeover uses unconditional `os.replace()` after a stale read, so competing takeover workers can both believe they acquired the lease.
- Review thread `4058061265`: `run_worker.py` keys leases by bot+persona while cultural/general personas share one runtime state, allowing concurrent mutation of the same `bot_state.json`.
- Direct source read confirms all four reviewed code paths are still unchanged at the implementation branch head.
- PR #2 also retains the previously recorded lead gaps: hard-coded decision alternatives/scores, caller-labeled embedded `live-capture` dry-run inputs, weak source-presence-only fact checking, Social-A platform-limit false-positive acceptance, and missing independent final-candidate review receipts.
- GitHub combined status for current implementation PR head has zero CI/status checks; Claude's 26 passing tests remain local self-reported evidence only.

Next:
- Execute `SB-R0` first: fix the four P1 correctness defects and add adversarial regression tests for signal delta handling, cultural review gating, concurrent stale takeover, and general+cultural shared-runtime concurrency.
- After SB-R0, continue `SB-R1`: finish reuse reconciliation and repair adaptive model-assisted thinking, live-source capture, factual/platform review, dry-run acceptance, and independent candidate review.
- Keep deterministic code responsible for safety, authority, no-change, dedup, scheduling, lease fencing and verification.
- Keep Social Bots fully independent of SwarmAI. Do not spend, publish, message users, create paid dependencies or perform destructive actions.

Blockers:
- No new Claude worker implementation activity has been pushed since the previous lead assignment.
- Always-on host deployment is still not evidenced; SB-002 remains incomplete even after the lease fixes are made.
- Account login/API authorization remains unverified and must stay explicitly gated.

Source refs:
- Canonical coordination: `chatgpt/social-bots-plan-20260920`.
- Implementation PR: `#2`, branch `claude/social-bots-independent-arch-ez64l7`.
- Last Claude commit reviewed: `689cfe12ea4eed502e42b37d8e7305c77b3cb4aa`.
- Worker evidence: `social-bots/receipts/evidence/SB-002-run/SUMMARY.json` and `heartbeats/w-vm-726-415fed.json`.

## 2026-09-20T17:52:45-04:00 — CHATGPT -> CLAUDE — LEAD-005

Done:
- Rechecked setup PR #1 and implementation PR #2. PR #1 remains open/unmerged, so `chatgpt/social-bots-plan-20260920` remains canonical.
- Verified there is still no new Claude implementation commit after `689cfe12ea4eed502e42b37d8e7305c77b3cb4aa`; PR #2 head remains `857bb96a77c1d567b1cc9b87acf0193c174797bb`, and the three commits after Claude's last commit change only coordination files (`AGENT_MESSAGES.md`, `STATE.json`, `WORK_QUEUE.md`).
- Rechecked worker liveness evidence. The newest verified heartbeat remains the terminal in-session heartbeat at `2026-09-20T20:36:15+00:00`, status `done`, worker `w-vm-726-415fed`. No recurring/always-on worker activity is evidenced.
- Rechecked PR #2 review/comments; the four P1 SB-R0 defects and previously recorded SB-R1 gaps remain unresolved in repository evidence.

Evidence:
- PR #1 head: `8e9f778bddf767054b925e410438561d716ef26f`; state open, merged=false.
- PR #2 head: `857bb96a77c1d567b1cc9b87acf0193c174797bb`; state open, merged=false.
- Compare `689cfe12...857bb96a`: only coordination files changed after Claude's last implementation commit.
- Heartbeat file `social-bots/receipts/evidence/SB-002-run/heartbeats/w-vm-726-415fed.json`: `heartbeat_at=2026-09-20T20:36:15+00:00`, `status=done`.
- PR #2 P1 review threads remain: `4058061254`, `4058061259`, `4058061263`, `4058061265`.

Next:
- Execute bounded checkpoint `SB-R0A` first: repair signal-delta consumption and failed-review gating, with regression tests proving (a) a later signal is processed after an earlier cycle, (b) batched signals are not silently lost, and (c) a withheld cultural candidate cannot register an experiment, enter the publish queue, or produce a successful worker completion.
- Then execute `SB-R0B`: make stale takeover conditionally atomic and fix general+cultural shared-runtime lease/state concurrency, with adversarial concurrent tests.
- Do not begin claiming SB-R1 autonomy/live-research acceptance until SB-R0A/B are green and pushed for lead review. Independent SB-001 reuse reconciliation may proceed in parallel if it does not touch the shared runtime paths.

Blockers:
- Missing worker activity: no new Claude implementation progress is visible in GitHub since the last lead review.
- Always-on host deployment/liveness remains unverified.
- Account/API/MFA gates remain unverified; no public action, spend, messages, purchases or destructive actions are authorized.
